			Every time I listen to the song Dusty Trails by Lucius I get a little bit sad.
			There's a part at the end that speaks a lot to where I am right now. It goes: <br> <br>
			"I'm halfway to misery <br>
			Some say when you go halfway there's still plenty of time to return <br>
			Oh, am I halfway to heaven? <br>
			Some may say when you go halfway, you only have halfway to go." <br> <br>
			I can't believe sophomore year is over. I can't believe I'll be a junior soon. That feels so OLD.</p>
