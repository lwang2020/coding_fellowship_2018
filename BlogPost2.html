				I am working at Less Annoying CRM this summer and so far it is really awesome.
				Everyone is really chill and all the other "fellows" are super nice.
				It's weird to call them fellows though; I feel like I'm in an old-timey musical.
				Like, "Why hello, you're a nice looking fellow. Would you care to learn how to code today?"
				It also seems a little ironic that we're called fellows, since this "fellowship" was designed exclusively for women,
				and the term "fellow" has traditionally referred to a male. Is there even a feminine version of the word fellow?
				Fella? Nope, that refers to a man too.
