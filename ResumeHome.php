						Writing lots of stuff! Why don't I try putting some song lyrics in here? Okay let's do that.

						[Intro: Capleton]
						Blazin, mi don't want dem
						Mi need dem
						Blazin
						Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
						And now she find out what life is really worth
						No to X rated
						Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
						And now she find out what life is really worth
						No to X rated

						[Intro]
						I am a god
						I am a god
						I am a god

						[Hook]
						I am a god
						Hurry up with my damn massage
						Hurry up with my damn m√©nage
						Get the Porsche out the damn garage
						I am a god
						Even though I'm a man of God
						My whole life in the hand of God
						So y'all better quit playin' with God

						[Verse 1]
						Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
						Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
						The only rapper compared to Michael
						So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
						And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
						And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
						Old niggas mentally still in high school
						Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
						Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
						But everybody know you brought real rap back
						Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
						Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
						Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
						Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
						Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
						Until the day I get struck by lightning

						[Hook]
						I am a god
						So hurry up with my damn massage
						In a French-ass restaurant
						Hurry up with my damn croissants
						I am a god
						I am a god
						I am a god

						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

						[Verse 2]
						I just talked to Jesus
						He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
						I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
						Tryna stack these millions"
						I know he the most high
						But I am a close high
						Mi casa, su casa
						That's our cosa nostra
						I am a god
						I am a god
						I am a god
						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
						AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

						[Outro: Justin Vernon]
						Ain't no way I'm givin' up. I'm a god.
